I have 4.5 years of prior experience as a CTO, lead developer, and full-stack developer in several startups, which enabled me to acquire a diverse set of technical and non-technical skills.

I'm eager to rejoin the tech scene after a career break. Previously, I worked on diverse projects for startups, showcasing my full-stack development skills. I'm also adept at learning new technologies, working independently, managing teams, being agile, handling pressure, and collaborating closely with customers.

During my career break, I learned different technologies and enrolled in a data science bootcamp which will finish at the end of March. In the bootcamp, I have built projects using machine learning algorithms from Scikit-Learn, Neural Networks from TensorFlow, performed Exploratory Data Analysis using Matplotlib, pandas, and numpy, etc.

I aim to integrate my data science skills with my previous full-stack development experiences to create more valuable products.

I'm excited about making a positive impact at work, helping customers solve complex technical problems, collaborating with a new team, and learning from each other. Additionally, I look forward to learning new skills and technologies in my new workplace.
